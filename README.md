# ComputationalGenomics

This repository consists of various projects and assignments which were complete in my Computational Genomics course at the University of South Florida.

Topics include basic plotting in R through base and ggplot2 functions, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq analysis pipelines, 16s microbiome sequencing, and DNA Methylation analysis.
